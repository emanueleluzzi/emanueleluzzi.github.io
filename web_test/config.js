            title: "The Impact of Machine Learning on Market Microstructure: Evidence from High-Frequency Trading",
            coauthors: "with John Doe and Jane Smith",
            abstract: "This paper examines how machine learning algorithms have transformed market microstructure in modern financial markets. Using a comprehensive dataset of high-frequency trading activity, we document significant changes in price discovery, liquidity provision, and market efficiency following the widespread adoption of ML-based trading strategies. Our findings suggest that while ML enhances price efficiency in normal market conditions, it may amplify volatility during periods of market stress. We develop a theoretical framework that captures these dual effects and provides testable implications for regulatory policy.",

            title: "Intermediary Asset Pricing in the Age of Big Data",
            coauthors: "Solo authored",
            abstract: "I study how financial intermediaries' use of alternative data and machine learning affects asset prices and market dynamics. Building on the intermediary asset pricing framework, I show that data-driven strategies create new channels of risk transmission across markets. The model predicts that intermediaries with superior data processing capabilities earn higher risk-adjusted returns but also contribute to systemic fragility. Empirical tests using proprietary data from major financial institutions support these predictions, revealing a fundamental trade-off between individual firm performance and market stability.",

            title: "Deep Learning and Cross-Sectional Asset Pricing: A New Frontier",
            coauthors: "with Maria Garcia",
            abstract: "We develop a novel deep learning framework for understanding cross-sectional variation in expected returns. Unlike traditional factor models, our approach allows for complex, non-linear interactions between firm characteristics and risk premia. The model uncovers previously hidden patterns in the data and generates out-of-sample Sharpe ratios that significantly exceed those of existing methods. We provide economic interpretation of the learned representations and show how they relate to fundamental sources of systematic risk. Preliminary results suggest that machine learning can bridge the gap between empirical asset pricing and economic theory.",
